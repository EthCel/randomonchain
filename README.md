# Chainlink VRF Random Number Generator for NFT Casting

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the use of Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) contract to generate fair and provably random numbers for casting random NFTs. The advantage of using random numbers is to create variability in token mints.

## Features

- **Chainlink VRF Integration**: Utilizes Chainlink's VRF contract to obtain secure and verifiable random numbers.
- **NFT Casting**: Users can request a random number which corresponds to a random tokenId.


## TODO

- **Lottery**: Creating a lottery contract that uses the VRF.
